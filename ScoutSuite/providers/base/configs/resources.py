This module provides some abstract classes for representing a hierarchical structure.
Especially since all cloud providers (AWS, Azure and GCP for now) organize their resources (virtual machines,
databases, load balancers, user accounts and so on...) with some kind of hierarchy, these classes may be
used to reflect that.
